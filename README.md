# 2. Getting the hosting
The hosting link is: https://bot-hosting.net
or use this(i dont prefer it): https://sillydevelopment.co.uk

# 2.1 Creating a server
when u on the site, click to the 3 lines and click earn credits and get 10 credits(its free)

# 2.2 Opening the server
To open the server, click on 3 lines again and click "Create Server"
on there there would be name thing do it whatever you want
and for the server languege do it python
after that click on "View on control panel"
and wait the "running imstaller" text go gone

# 3 File Replacement
Now click on files
and click "Upload" Button

and delete the zip after extracting

# 3.1 Getting the port
now go back to console
you will see something called "Address" on bottom of the output(console)
click to the "address" and it will copy something
after the ":" symbol there would be numbers
copy those numbers, we will need those numbers

# 3.2 Setting up the port
Now go to the files page and click on "main.py" file
scroll all the way down on the code
you will see something like '0.0.0.0 9339'
now delete that 9339 and put the port u just copied it(this will run the server on hosting)
and after that click save content(the blue button) to save the file

# 4 Setting up the run file
Go to the startup page
scroll down until you see "bot py file"
now delete that bot.py and change it to "main.py"
and bottom of that, you will see additional python packages
type on that box this:
colorama tinydb
and leave that page

# 5 Putting the port on apk
Now, go to the mt manager
scroll to the right on the right side
and click apk extract(something like that)
and select the apk u got
and extract it
after that, go to the your brawl stars apk file
