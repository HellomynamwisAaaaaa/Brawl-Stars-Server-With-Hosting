# Brawl-Stars-Server-With-Hosting
For me and everyone idk
I heard the hosting is bad but no problem

What u need for this page: MT Manager(for apk extract), zip maker(can be done by ZArchiver), Hosting(gonna give it later)
# 1. Getting the zip and apk
https://t.me/AllModsBrawlStars
Get the zip and apk from here im too lazy to explain

# 2. Getting the hosting
look up for the hostings

# 2.1 Creating a server
when u on the site, click to the 3 lines and click earn credits and get 10 credits(its free + this is for bot hosting site, if u selected the other 2 websites figure it out yourself)

# 2.2 Opening the server
To open the server, click on 3 lines again and click "Create Server"
on there there would be name thing do it whatever you want
and for the server languege do it python
after that click on "View on control panel"
and wait the "running imstaller" text go gone
(For bot hosting site again)

# 3 File Replacement
Now click on files
and click "Upload" Button
upload the server zip u got
extract the zip
and delete the zip after extracting

# 3.1 Getting the port
now go back to console
you will see something called "Address" on bottom of the output(console)
click to the "address" and it will copy something
after the ":" symbol there would be numbers
copy those numbers, we will need those numbers

# 3.2 Setting up the port
Now go to the files page and click on "main.py" file
scroll all the way down on the code
you will see something like '0.0.0.0 9339'
now delete that 9339 and put the port u just copied it(this will run the server on hosting)
and after that click save content(the blue button) to save the file

# 4 Setting up the run file
Go to the startup page
scroll down until you see "bot py file"
now delete that bot.py and change it to "main.py"
and bottom of that, you will see additional python packages
type on that box this:
colorama tinydb

## Or if you use sql server do this:
### colorama tinydb mongo pymongo schedule

## This installs the other packages

and leave that page

# 5 Putting the port on apk
Now, go to the mt manager
scroll to the right on the right side
and click apk extract(something like that)
and select the apk u got
and extract it
after that, go to the your brawl stars apk file
click lib
and click arm something like that
go to the mod.config thing like click on the one who says config idk
put this ln redirectHost:
65.108.77.37

## If you not saw the config thing, you probably downloaded the not self hosted version

## NOTE! No, you dont gonna put "65.108.77.37" if you using silly development (pylexnodes got their own ip thing)

and put your port that u copied earlier on redirectPort
save the file
now go back to the hosting
start the server

and here u go

fully functional hosted brawl stars server wow lol


you can upgrade ram and disk to put somethings btw

 ## have something to ask? my discord is: batus_zz
